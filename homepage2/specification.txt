Javascript:
I used javascript for 2 things:
- First being checking for all the checkboxes in the home page (or index.html) and changing the image and play music if all of them are checked.
- Secondly, making a password page to validate user's input for the documentation page (if you see this message, the password is "cs50" but in reversed)

Bootstrap:
- I used it to make the nav bar that is everywhere in the webpage.
- It also provided me with easy ways to make the download button for the docs.
